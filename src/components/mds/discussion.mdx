SVG demonstrates that **semantic disentanglement is far more critical than latent feature dimensionality for training conditional diffusion models**. While VAEs aim to remove imperceptible details and preserve semantically meaningful image components within a low-dimensional latent space, they often lack a semantically disentangled structure, which limits their effectiveness in guiding diffusion modeling.

Given that the SVG feature space is particularly effective for **grounding and reconstruction**, it offers a more efficient and unified representation for training models capable of **both editing and generation**.

Furthermore, SVG shows the potential to simultaneously address core vision tasks such as understanding, perception, and generationâ€”capabilities that are essential for **building unified vision models or world models**.
